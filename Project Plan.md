## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application that serves as a simple data analysis and visualisation tool. The project will be divided into two main phases which are the design phase and implementation. 
In the first phase, the focus will be on designing the tool including the layout, user interface, and the overall architecture. The design phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for the application, ensuring it is user-friendly and meets all specified requirements.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

The project success hinges on the active involvement of several key stakeholders, each playing a distinct role in ensuring the project meets its objectives and delivers a high-quality product. For this project here are the stakeholders needed:
* **Project manager**: The project manager oversee the entire project, ensuring it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets all objectives/requirements. The project manager coordinate the effort of the team, manage resources, and act as the main point of contact between the project team and other stakeholders. The project manager is also responsible for keeping the project aligned with its goals and ensuring the milestones are achieved on time.
  
* **Developers**: Developers are responsible for the implementation of the software. They will write the code, integrate, and ensure that the application functions according to the design specifications. Developers work closely with designers to bring the project from concept to reality, addressing any technical challenges that arise.
  
* **Designers**: Designers focus on creating the interface and user experince of the application. They create layouts, wireframes, and prototypes to guide the development process and ensure that the end product meets user needs and expectations.
  
* **Front and End Users**: The Front users are mainly internal stakeholders (team members/testers) who interact with the software during the development phase. Their role is to provide feedback on the functionality and usability of the application, and identify any issues that needs improvement before the realse. On the other hand, End users are the people who will use the final application. Their needs are central to the design and functionality of the website/application. The project team aims to meets the end users' requirement, and their feedback is needed during the testing phase to ensure the website/application is practical and user-friendly.


### 1.3 Project Scope

The project scope focuses on planning and designing the desktop application. The team will start by analysing the dataset to determine the application's requirements. We will then design the user interface, create layouts and prototypes to ensure the tool is user-friendly and meets project goals. Alongside UI design, we will plan the software's structure, and decide how different parts will connect and function.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

| Activity #No | Activity Name | Brief Description | Duration | Responsible Team Members |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| xxx          | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx \& yyy               |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | All                      |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx                      |

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
