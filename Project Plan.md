## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application that serves as a simple data analysis and visualisation tool. The project will be divided into two main phases which are the design phase and implementation. 
In the first phase, the focus will be on designing the toolm including the layout, user interface, and the overall architecture. The design phase is crucial as it sets the foundation for the application, ensuring it is user-friendly and meets all specified requirements.

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

* Project team
* Developers
* Designers
* Front and End Users


### 1.3 Project Scope

The project scope focuses on planning and designing the desktop application. The team will start by analysing the dataset to determine the application's requirements. We will then design the user interface, create layouts and prototypes to ensure the tool is user-friendly and meets project goals. Alongside UI design, we will plan the software's structure, and decide how different parts will connect and function.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure

Include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the entire project. WBS should be presented as a hierarchical diagram. Use the elements from the WBS to define activities in Section 3, and schedule these activities in the Gantt Chart in Section 4. Ensure all project activities are considered and included in the WBS.

## 3. Activity Definition Estimation

Define the activities required for your project based on the WBS, and assign responsibilities to team members. Each activity should be numbered and correspond with your Gantt chart. Provide estimated durations for each activity to facilitate Gantt chart preparation.

| Activity #No | Activity Name | Brief Description | Duration | Responsible Team Members |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| xxx          | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx \& yyy               |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | All                      |
| xxxx         | xxx           | xxx               | xxx      | xxx                      |

## 4. Gantt Chart
You have to use the provided Gantt chart template.  

Use the provided Gantt chart template to list all items from the Activity Definition along with relevant estimates 
and scheduling. Ensure that the Gantt chart reflects the activity definitions from Section 3. Track actual start 
times and durations. Besides including Gantt chart here, you should also submit your Gantt chart file separately.
